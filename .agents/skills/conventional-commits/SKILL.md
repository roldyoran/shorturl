This skill enforces the use of conventional commits format for all git commits. All commit messages MUST be written in English only.

## Conventional Commits Specification

Commit messages must follow this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<descriptive body explaining what was done in the files>
```

### Types

Use one of the following types:
- `feat` — A new feature
- `fix` — A bug fix
- `refactor` — Code refactoring without changing behavior
- `docs` — Documentation changes
- `test` — Adding or updating tests
- `chore` — Maintenance tasks, tooling, dependencies
- `perf` — Performance improvements
- `style` — Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `build` — Build system or dependency changes
- `ci` — CI configuration changes
- `revert` — Reverting a previous commit

### Scope

The scope is optional but recommended when it adds clarity. Use a scope that describes the area of the codebase:

**Frontend:**
- `ui` — User interface, components, pages
- `router` — Routing, navigation, redirects
- `state` — State management, stores
- `forms` — Form handling, validation
- `styles` — CSS, styling, themes

**Backend:**
- `api` — API endpoints, routes, controllers
- `db` — Database, migrations, schemas, queries
- `auth` — Authentication, authorization, sessions
- `middleware` — Middleware, interceptors
- `services` — Business logic, services

**General:**
- `config` — Configuration files, environment
- `deps` — Dependencies, packages
- `tests` — Test files and test infrastructure
- `docs` — Documentation
- `infra` — Infrastructure, deployment
- `utils` — Utility functions, helpers
- `types` — Types, interfaces, schemas
- `i18n` — Internationalization, translations
- `logging` — Logging, monitoring
- `security` — Security fixes, sanitization
- `cache` — Caching, caching strategies
- `email` — Email templates, notifications
- `file` — File handling, uploads
- `mobile` — Mobile-specific changes (React Native, Flutter, etc.)
- `desktop` — Desktop application changes

### Description

- Use imperative mood: "add" not "added" or "adds"
- Keep it concise (max 50 characters)
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No period at the end

### Body

The body is **mandatory** and must:
- Be descriptive about what was done in the files that were changed
- Explain the "what" and "why", not "how"
- Be brief but informative (1-3 lines recommended)
- Reference any related issues or PRs if applicable

### Examples

```
feat(api): add user registration endpoint

Created new POST endpoint for user signup with validation. Added password hashing and token generation.
```

```
fix(ui): resolve button alignment on mobile

Fixed spacing issue in the navigation component that caused buttons to overflow on small screens.
```

```
refactor(db): optimize query performance

Restructured database queries to reduce N+1 problems. Added proper indexing for frequently accessed columns.
```

```
test(auth): add integration tests for login flow

Created test suite covering valid credentials, invalid credentials, and session timeout scenarios.
```

```
chore(deps): update React to version 18

Upgraded React and related packages to latest stable version. Fixed deprecation warnings.
```

```
perf(utils): improve array processing speed

Replaced forEach with map for better performance. Added memoization for expensive computations.
```

## Rules

1. **Language**: All commit messages MUST be in English
2. **Format**: Follow the conventional commits structure exactly
3. **Body required**: Always include a descriptive body that explains what was changed
4. **Imperative mood**: Use "add", "fix", "update" not "added", "fixed", "updated"
5. **No emoji**: Do not use emojis in commit messages
6. **Breaking changes**: Prefix with `!` after type/scope or use `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer
